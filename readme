*
* Module containing a stripped-down implementation of Needlemanâ€“Wunsch
* algorithm that only returns the best global alignment score, not any
* alignments. Allows for gap extension penalites. Space scaling lowered
* to O(min(n, m)) using the observation that only the current and
* previous row of the score matrix must be stored.
*
* Future updates will allow for penalty matrices as well as the option
* to return AN alignment using a modified Hirschberg algorithm. An
* option to return all optimal alignments is unlikely, as both time
* and space scaling guarantees are lost.
